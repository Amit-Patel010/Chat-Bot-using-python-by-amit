# Chat-Bot-using-python-by-amit
Hey its Amit here
This Python-based chatbot uses the Wikipedia API to provide quick and accurate answers to user queries. Simply type a question, and the chatbot fetches relevant information from Wikipedia in real-time.
It takes little time but you can ask this bot for example who's Trump and it will give you answer based on wikipedia 
the other project can interact with human like human feeling 
:)
